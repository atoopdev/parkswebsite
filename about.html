        <p>My name is Keir, and I am running for a position on the Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District Board of Directors. </p>


        <p>Hood River is a remarkable and beautiful place, and we need to wisely manage and protect each unique facet of it: forests, rivers, agricultural land and community character. We need to design and build parks that later generations can be proud of; parks that reflect and honor our community and the land we inhabit. 
          
          We need to build facilities that promote wellness and foster inclusive community. An inclusive community needs a parks board that consists of people from different backgrounds, with different strengths and ideas; working people, as well as administrators and professionals.</p>

        <p>I am a long time resident of West Hood River. I grew up in the Valley during the 1980's and 1990's. Back when Hood River was a small town. </p>
        <img class="img-small image-right-float" src="./images/family2.jpg">
        
        <p>After college and some years away, I moved back to the home I grew up in and to the trees my mom planted. </p>
        
        
        
        <p>I work as a union electrician with IBEW Local 48, but my first love is nature and wild places. I live with my two cats, Semi and Ridealong, and enjoy diy projects, reading, hiking, and paddling/rowing/sailing local waterways in my free time.</p>

        <img class="img-extra-small image-left-float" src="./images/family1.jpg">

        <p>Please look over my website and some of the ideas I have to help move Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District forward. </p>
        <p>I will be adding content over the next month, so check back!</p>

        <p>Thank you for considering me for the Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District Board.</p>
