        <h2>A History of Barrett Park</h2>
        <p>In the commentary below, I have included a brief history of Barrett Park in West Hood River, and my experience addressing the issues of the Barrett Park RC flying field and the non-permitted rest area/open space with Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District management and local elected officials</p>

        <h3>From Community Playing Fields to a Playground for RC Hobbyists: A Brief History of Barrett Park</strong></h3>
<p>After a 2003 countywide public opinion survey identified new playing fields as one of the top recreational needs in Hood River County, Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District made development of new playing fields a top priority. The District's 2005 Capital Facilities Master Plan indicated that: <em>"Hood River County has a critical shortage of public field space for baseball, soccer, and lacrosse." </em>To address this need, the Parks District started searching for land.</p>
<p>The 2006 acquisition of the working orchard at 4010 Barrett Dr was partially funded by a <span class="underline">$325,800 grant</span> from Oregon State Parks, and occurred for the express purpose of providing additional playing fields for the Hood River community.</p>
<p><span class="emphasis">The problem was, the 32 acre orchard the District purchased isn't zoned for dedicated sports playing fields</span>; it's zoned Exclusive Farm Use (EFU). Plus it's on a hill. In other words: not flat. Nevertheless, the District bought the property and commissioned an architectural site plan for a playing field complex that was mailed to county officials and adjacent property owners.</p>
<p>By 2011, Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District had owned the Barrett property for over 3 years, <span class="underline">received an additional $494,000</span> from the State Parks Department Local Government Grant program, and learned that <span class="emphasis">building a ballfield complex on the property might be nearly impossible.</span> Although playing fields had been identified as top priority for the District and were the reason for the initial purchase, <span class="underline">the plan shifted to a multi-use park.</span> A second site plan was commissioned and mailed out to interested parties.</p>

<p><span class="emphasis">Local land use oversight and community advocacy organization Thrive Hood River (Hood River Valley Resident's Committee) lobbied the District to sell the property and purchase a property not zoned as exclusive farm use/high value farmland (EFU/HVF).</span> The alternate property they suggested is located on the corner of Fairview Rd and Belmont Drive, diagonally across from Westside School. However, the District remained committed to the Barrett property, despite the fact their $325,800 grant could have been redirected to a property with a better prognosis for development.</p>
<p>In winter 2011, the Parks District had the pear and apple trees ripped out with backhoes in order to "keep their grant."</p>
<p>In the face of a legal challenge to the project from a local farmer, <span class="underline">the District proceeded to spend at least $85,500 of taxpayer money on attorneys and consultants</span> to fuel years of appeals. All to develop a piece of agricultural land that no longer worked for playing fields.</p>
<p>In December 2013, the Hood River County Board of Commissioners rejected the District's application to for a conditional use permit to develop Barrett for a second time.</p>
<p><span class="emphasis">In 2014, over my strenuous objections, Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District installed a 300' radio-controlled aircraft runway 85 feet from my property, and opened the property to drones and other RC aircraft from dawn to dusk, 365 days/year.</span> The negative impact from this to neighbors has grown with each successive year.</p>

      <h3>85 feet?! How can this be? Aren't there rules and laws that protect neighboring property owners?</h3>
<p>In 1997, a group of state legislators did a favor for one state senator's constituent: a wealthy Willamette Valley landowner. These legislators made flying fields for radio-controlled aircraft an outright allowed usage on EFU land. No permit needed. Perhaps they thought of EFU land as expansive acreage with no close neighbors. Perhaps it didn't cross their mind that anyone would be put an RC runway 85 feet from a neighboring property. Regardless, they included no protections for neighboring residents and property owners and no minimum distance RC flying fields must be located from occupied dwellings. </p>
<p>In subsequent years, a few attempts were made in the Oregon legislature to either repeal this change or introduce language meant to protect adjacent landowners/residents. All were stalled in committee.</p>
<p>A recent attempt to change the law came in 2021-22 when I contacted former State Representative Anna Williams (D-HD52) about introducing language into the Oregon Revised Statutes to impose restrictions on the distance an RC flying field can be located from an occupied residence.</p>
<p>You can read those emails <a href="letters.html#staterepresentative" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Rep. Williams ultimately did not respond to a follow-up email I sent in March 2022, and resigned from the Oregon Legislature in August 2022.</p>
<h3>What about the County? Don't they have anything to say about a public RC flying field being located next to established residences? What about quality of life? Hood River is supposed to be a great place to live.</h3>
<p>Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District publicly advertises Barrett Park as a community park and open space, but they do not have a conditional use permit that allows them to use the property in this way. Non-authorized usage of the property occurs daily.</p>
<p>In 2019, I wrote to County Community Development Director Eric Walker whose office is responsible for enforcing Oregon land use laws in Hood River County about the non-authorized usage of the property.</p>
<p>You can read the questions I asked and Eric Walker's responses to them <a href="letters.html#countycommunitydevelopment" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>In this exchange, Eric Walker confirms that Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District does not have the conditional use permit required to operate the property as a community park and open space. Eric Walker then tells me that his office will not be enforcing Oregon land use law in this case.</p>
<p class="underline">Why does a paid county administrator get to decide whether or not to enforce Oregon land use law?</p>
<p>In April 2022, I emailed a letter to the five people serving on the Hood River County Board of Commissioners at that time: Mike Oates, Karen Joplin, Arthur Babitz, Bob Benton, and Les Perkins. <span class="underline">Not one of those five people acknowledged or responded to my letter.</span></p>

        <h3>The Takeaway: Building on failure is costly</h3>
<p><span class="emphasis">Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District received <span class="underline">$819,800 dollars</span> from Oregon State Parks to provide Hood River County with a new community recreational property.</span></p>
<p>However:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="space-below">Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District has <span class="underline">failed to provide one single new playing field</span> since the need was recognized in 2003. 
The community is still playing on the same playing fields available for use when I was a kid here. </li>
    <li class="space-below">Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District has <span class="underline">failed to provide a westside community park</span> to a generation of Hood River's kids. The kids who were born when the Barrett orchard was purchased in 2006 are now 17 years old. </li>
    <li class="space-below">The $494,000 in grant dollars meant for the development of our westside community park was redirected to fund the development of the Golden Eagle Pump Track and ball courts. </li>
    <li class="space-below">In 2021, Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District purchased the Fairview property for a westside community park. This is the same property diagonal to Westside Elementary School that Thrive Hood River lobbied for as an alternative to Barrett so many years ago. The District currently lacks the money to develop it. </li>
    <li class="space-below"><span class="underline">Barrett Park is the "official flying field" of the Columbia Gorge Aeromodelers, a private RC club.</span> Hood River County taxpayers are paying for the upkeep and maintenance of this property while Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District provides it to the Columbia Gorge Aeromodelers free of charge. This is what I learned from Director Mark Hickok in 2019. </li>
    <li class="space-below"><span class="underline">Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District could have sold Barrett and rolled the grant into a comparable property</span> when they failed to receive a conditional use permit in 2013. </li>
    <li class="space-below">They could have returned Barrett to farmland.</li>
    <li class="space-below">They could have prioritized building Hood River a community park. </li>
    <li class="space-below">Instead, the 17 year long history of Barrett Park is a story of inflexible egos and prioritizing special interests. </li>
</ul>
<p>Hood River deserved better. </p>
<p>Hood River deserves better.</p>
