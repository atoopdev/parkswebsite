        <h2>Everyone Benefits From Community Involvement</h2>

        <h3>Community Advisory Panels</h3>
        <p>I would like to see Parks and Rec decision making become more inclusive of the community and allow input beyond town hall meetings. If elected I would work to establish community advisory panels for all major projects.</p>

        <h3>Youth Council</h3>
        <p>I believe in listening to kids and encouraging their active participation in the policy decisions which shape their world.</p>



    <p>As youth are the focus of the District, they deserve to have a tangible role in the planning and development of Hood River Valleyâ€™s green spaces and recreational opportunities.</p>



    <p>I support the formation of a Youth Council comprised of students from local schools to serve in an advisory capacity to the elected board of Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District.</p>



    <h3>Benefits to youth councillors would include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Civic engagement</li>

            <li>Applied leadership experience</li>

             <li>Development of problem solving/critical thinking skills </li>

            </ul>
    

 



<p>I believe Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District should perform yearly outreach to local schools to gather input from students on their experiences and level of involvement with recreational opportunities in the Hood River Valley. </p>



<p>Sports and recreational activities should have a level playing field. </p>



<p>We need to know if there are kids being left behind.</p>
