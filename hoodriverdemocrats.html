  <meta property="og:title" content="Why I am Not Endorsed by Hood River County Democrats"/>
  <meta property="og:description" content="Despite being a registered Democrat and having strong progressive values, Keir was excluded from Hood River County Democrats' endorsement list. The co-chairs of the party cited a conflict regarding the Barrett Park RC Flying Field located near Keir's property. Keir shares his platform, values, and hopes that voters will make their own decision in the upcoming non-partisan election for the parks board. Learn more at keirforparks.com."/>

        <p>Registered Democrats in Hood River may be getting an endorsement letter/postcard in the mail soon listing the preferred candidates supported by the Hood River County Democrats. This information is already available on their website.</p>

        <p>Although I am a registered Democrat and lifelong Democratic voter with strong progressive values, my name is not included on that list.</p>

      <p>Why?</p>

      <p>The co-chairs of the Hood River County Democrats decided that “<a href="neighborsperspective.html">my conflict</a>” with Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District about the Barrett Park RC Flying Field runway located 85 feet from my property <span class="emphasis">disqualified</span> me as a candidate worth supporting.</p>

      <p>These two people did not follow up with me to learn more about this “conflict” and how I have been treated by District or take the time to learn more about my platform and the issues I care about.</p>

      <p>I relayed my intention to run for parks board to them after their March 2023 meeting, and it was immediately clear to me that I was considered an unwelcome addition to the race. Before I even mentioned living next to the Barrett Park RC flying field, I was told they already had 3 Democrats running. Though one hadn’t declared at that time, they were saving a slot for them. However, the person I spoke to after that meeting told me that the <span class="underline">Hood River County Democrats would either be endorsing all Democrats in the race or none of us.</span></p>

      <p>This turned out not to be true.</p>

<h3>Insider politics in a non-partisan race?</h3>

<p>The race for Hood River Valley Parks & Recreation Board is a non-partisan race, but what these party endorsements do is tell voters that a candidate shares their values and helps get their name out there.</p> 
  <p>Is it fair that the leaders of the Hood River County Democrats feel like they are entitled to exclude a registered Democrat from being included as a Democrat on Democratic Party campaign materials? </p>
<p>Is it just that the leaders of the Hood River County Democrats feel like they should get to decide which Democratic candidates are acceptable and which are not?</p>

<p>Or should it be up to voters.</p>

<p>I hope my values are clear to you from the content of this website. I have worked hard to research issues and build a platform of ideas that I believe will help promote accountability and involve the community more fully in decision making for the District. <span class="emphasis">I believe positive change requires a critical mind, and the ability to both acknowledge problems and find solutions.</span> As candidates and as citizens, I do not believe it is our job to mutely acquiesce to those who hold power. It is not in our best interest to have an elected board function as a rubber stamp on the agenda of paid administrators. I believe my job as a candidate is to communicate to you how I would safeguard your interests and the community property Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District is tasked with managing. I have taken this job seriously.</p>

<p>I will leave it to you to decide whether you think Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District has treated the Hood River residents who live adjacent to Barrett Park RC flying field fairly and with compassion and whether they have respected our wellbeing and and our right to enjoy our property. </p>

<p>It will not surprise you to know that my candidacy partly derives from what I feel to be an injustice; ten years of fighting an unequal fight. I have pursued my objections to the RC field with tenacity. If elected, I will bring that same tenacity to work for you on the Board. </p>
