Examine BitLocker
BitLocker provides additional protection for a computer’s operating system and any data that is stored on that operating system or in other volumes. BitLocker helps ensure that data stored on a computer remains encrypted, even if someone tampers with the computer while the operating system is not running.
address the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers. Data on these types of computers can become vulnerable to unauthorized access when a hacker either runs a software attack tool against it or transfers the computer’s hard disk to a different computer.
BitLocker also helps render data inaccessible when you decommission or recycle BitLocker-protected computers.

BitLocker performs two functions that provide both offline data protection and system-integrity verification:
-It encrypts all data that is stored on the Windows operating system volume (and configured data volumes). This includes the Windows operating system, hibernation files and paging files, applications, and data that applications use.
-It is configured, by default, to use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip to help ensure the integrity of early startup components by ensuring that no modifications have been made to the trusted boot path, such as BIOS, boot sector, and boot manager. Once the TPM has verified that there are no changes, it releases the decryption key to the Windows OS Loader. If TPM does detect changes, it locks any BitLocker-protected volumes, so they remain protected even if someone tampers with the computer when the operating system is not running.

The Windows installation process partitions the computer’s hard disk to enable the use of BitLocker.

Windows now offers a newer encryption algorithm, XTS-AES, for BitLocker. Good for in person brute force attacks. Can be configured via group policy. Recommended for newly provisioned devices.

Evaluate BitLocker and TPMs (Truisted Platform Model Chip)
If an attacker can gain access to the startup process components, they can change the code in these components and gain access to the computer even though the data on the disk is encrypted. Once the attacker gains access to confidential information such as BitLocker keys or user passwords, they can circumvent BitLocker and other Windows security protections.

BitLocker uses a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip to verify the integrity of the startup process by:
-verify that early boot file integrity has been maintained, and to help ensure that there has been no adverse modification of those files, such as with boot sector viruses or root kits.
-Enhancing protection to mitigate offline software-based attacks. Any alternative software that might start the system does not have access to the decryption keys for the Windows operating system volume.
-Locking the system when it is tampered with. Recovery process is suggested.

In conjunction with the TPM, BitLocker verifies the integrity of early startup components. This helps prevent additional offline attacks, such as attempts to insert malicious code into these components. This functionality is important because the components in the earliest part of the startup process must be available in an unencrypted format so that the computer can start.

Note: TPM functionality might need to be enabled in BIOS

To determine if a computer has a TPM version 1.2 chip, perform the following steps:

Open Control Panel, select System and Security, and then select BitLocker Drive Encryption.
In the lower left corner, select TPM Administration. The TPM Management on the Local Computer console opens. If the computer does not have the TPM 1.2 chip, the “Compatible TPM cannot be found” message displays.

Recover a BitLocker-encrypted drive
When a computer enters recovery mode, the user must enter the correct recovery password to continue. The recovery password is linked to a particular TPM or computer and not to an individual user.

You should save the recovery information either on a USB flash drive or in AD DS, using one of these formats:
-A 48-digit number divided into eight groups. During recovery, use the function keys to type this password into the BitLocker Recovery Console.
-A recovery key in a format that the BitLocker Recovery Console can read directly.

Scenarios where recovery is likely
-Switching the computer's encrypted hard drive to another computer.
-Making the BitLocker-encrypted drive subordinate to another computer to recover its data.
-Turning the computer off during the encryption process.
-Updating the computer’s firmware.
-Changing the device boot order in the computer’s BIOS.

Locating a BitLocker recovery password

Domain AD
A computer's password ID is a 32-character password unique to a computer name. You can find the password ID under a computer's property settings, which you can use to locate passwords stored in AD DS. To locate a password, the following conditions must be met:

-You must be a domain administrator or have delegate permissions.
-The client's BitLocker recovery information is configured for storage in AD DS.
-The client’s computer has been joined to a domain.
-BitLocker must be enabled on the client's computer.

Once have found computer right click "drive label" select properties>BitLocker Recovery tab.

To search by password ID, right-click the domain container, and then select Find BitLocker Recovery Password. In the Find BitLocker Recovery Password dialog box, enter the first eight characters of the password ID in the Password ID field, and then select Search.

Data recovery agent support (corp create key for encryption so always have unencryption access)
This technology assists in the recovery of corporate data on a portable drive using the key created by the enterprise.
Data recovery agent support allows you to dictate that all BitLocker-protected volumes (such as operating system, fixed, and new portable volumes), are encrypted with an appropriate data recovery agent. The data recovery agent is a new key protector that is written to each data volume so that authorized IT administrators will always have access to BitLocker-protected volumes.

Summary of Bitlocker:
encrypts volumes
doesn't protect against unauth privl accounts
protects OS from modification
easier to implement

Assess Encrypting Files System
Unlike BitLocker, which encrypts the entire volume, EFS encrypts individual files based on user accounts. Don't use if don't understand. Can result in data that cannot be recovered.

What is EFS?
EFS is a component of the NTFS file system, and it uses advanced, standard cryptographic algorithms to allow transparent file encryption and decryption. EFS functionality is also simulated on volumes that use the FAT32 file system. Any individual or app that doesn't have access to a certificate store that holds an appropriate cryptographic key can’t read encrypted data. You can protect encrypted files even from those who gain physical possession of a computer on which files are stored. Even people who have the authorization to access a computer and its file system can’t view the encrypted data.

Summary of EFS:
Encrypts files
Requires user certificates
Helps protect against unauthorized privl. accounts
doesn't protect os from modification
complex to implement

Common Scenarios for EFS
-Protecting files on shared computers. For when file permissions are not enough.
-Protecting files from privileged users. Many data breaches are caused by attackers getting access to a privileged account and using that privileged account to override file and folder permissions. While the default Administrator account is also the data recovery agent for EFS-protected files, this can be changed so that privileged accounts can’t access these files.
-Sharing encrypted files with specific users.
-With EFS, users can share encrypted files with other users on file shares and in web folders. This allows you to grant individual users’ permissions to access an encrypted file. After you encrypt a file, you can enable file sharing through the user interface. You first must encrypt a file and then save it before adding more users. You can add users from a local computer or from Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) if the users have a valid certificate for EFS. EFS certificates can be located in roaming profiles, in the user profiles on the computer that is storing the file, or in AD DS. Caution users to share files only with trusted accounts, as any user who is authorized to decrypt a file can authorize other users to access the file. Can remove write permissions but may not be ideal as then file cannot be modified.

Note: EFS-encrypted files don't remain encrypted when crossing the network, such as when you work with the files on a shared folder. The file is decrypted, and it then traverses the network in an unencrypted state. EFS encrypts it locally if you save it to a folder on the local drive that is configured for encryption. Solutions like WebDAV or IPSec can be used to keep files encrypted while traversing the network.
