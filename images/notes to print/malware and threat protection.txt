Malware and Threat Protection

There are several types of malware, including:

-Computer viruses. This type of malware replicates by inserting a copy of its executable code into other applications, operating-system files, data files, or hardware components, such as the BIOS or boot sector files.
-Computer worms. Worms are a special form of malware that replicate without direct intervention. Worms spread across networks and can infect other computers on a network, without requiring a user to open an email attachment or file.
-Trojan horses. This type of malware provides an attacker with remote access to the infected computer.
-Ransomware. This type of malware encrypts user data, and you can recover your data only if you pay a ransom to the malware authors.
-Spyware. This type of malware tracks how a computer is used without the user’s consent.

Determine possible mitigations for malware threats
There are many ways that you can help protect against malware infection on your devices, including that you:

Ensure that you apply all software and operating system updates to your devices.
Ensure that you install and activate anti-malware software on your devices.
Ensure that anti-malware definitions are current.
Avoid risky behavior, such as consuming pirated software or media.
Avoid opening suspicious email attachments, even if they are from senders that you trust.

Understand phishing scams
Phishing (pronounced "fishing") is a type of online identity theft. It uses email, phone calls, texts, and fraudulent websites that are designed to steal your personal data or information such as credit card numbers, passwords, account data, or other information.

Mitigating phishing threats
Phishing scams involve the exposure of login credentials or other secure data when the user is tricked into exposing them to the attacker. Therefore, educating users is necessary to minimize threats from phishing.
-fake websites
-thrests like account closure.
-spoofed email addresses and fake logos.

How to tell if an email is legitimate:
-hover over link to see url
-poor grammar, etc
-company contact info and branding

Explain common network-related security threats
-Eavesdropping. An eavesdropping attack, also known as network sniffing, occurs when a hacker captures network packets that workstations connected to your network send and receive. Eavesdropping attacks can compromise your organization’s sensitive data, such as passwords, which can lead to other, more damaging attacks.
-Denial of service (DoS) attack. This type of attack limits the function of a network app, or renders an app or network resource unavailable.overloading a service that replies to network requests, such as Domain Name System (DNS), with a large number of fake requests in an attempt to overload and shut down a service or the server that hosts the service. 
-Port scanning. Apps that run on a computer using the TCP/IP protocol use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) ports to identify themselves. One way that attackers exploit a network is to query hosts for open ports on which they listen for client requests. Once attackers identify an open port, they can use other attack techniques to access the services that are running on the computer.
-Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The network attacker uses a computer to impersonate a legitimate host on the network with which your computers are communicating. The attacker intercepts all of the communications that are intended for a destination host. The attacker might wish to view the data in transit between the two hosts, but also can modify that data before forwarding the packets to the destination host.

Determine mitigations for network-related security threats
-eavesdropping: IPsec, VPN, DirectAccess, intrusion detection
-DoS: Firewalls, perimeter networks, IPsec, Server hardening
-Port scanning: Server hardening, firewalls
-MITM: IPsec, DNSSEC
-Virus, malicious code: software updates

-Internet Protocol security (IPsec), which authenticates IP-based communications between two hosts and, where desirable, encrypt that network traffic.
-Firewalls, which allow or block network traffic based on the type of traffic.
-Perimeter networks, which are isolated areas on your network to and from which you can define network traffic flow.If server hosts internet services, place in permimeter network so whole network is not exposed to internet
-VPNs and DirectAccess.by using virtual private networks (VPNs) or DirectAccess, you can authenticate and encrypt connections between remote users and your organization’s intranet.
-Server hardening: run only the services you need.use tools such as the Security Configuration Wizard or the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer.
-Intrusion detection.Monitor for signs of attack using intrusion detection systems - usually internet facing routers.
-Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), which use digital signatures for validation, so that DNS servers and resolvers can trust DNS responses.
