Manage User Files
Standard best practices are for files to be stored on a file server, cloud service, or some form of redundant storage to ensure data is not loss.

Understand Windows Libraries
By default, certain libraries will already exist depending on which version of Windows you're using and which version you may have migrated from. These libraries may include:

Documents
Saved Pictures
Videos
Music
Camera Roll
Pictures

Adding a folder to a library doesn't physically move the folder on the computer; it simply associates the folder with a certain library. To add a folder to a library, right-click the folder and select Include in library and select a library.

Evaluate OneDrive
free cloud-based file service that is available to Microsoft account holders, with the option to purchase additional storage space.
Microsoft 365 subscriptions include 1TB of storage per user or more depending on the plan.
OneDrive, when used in an organization with certain Microsoft 365 plans, offers additional functionality, most notably, the option to store files in SharePoint.
Organizations that set up OneDrive for users to store their data in solve three significant problems:
-Data loss. Safe from hardware failure.
-Data migration. No need to migrate files with new devices.
-Anywhere access. Access at work and at home. From mult devices.

OneDrive features
-Known Folder Move. This redirects the common Windows known folders (Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Screenshots, and Camera Roll) to organizational Sharepoint storage. 
-OneDrive Files On-Demand. You can choose the storage preferences for individual files and folders. You can either synchronize between local and cloud storage for scenarios like offline access, and or keep files online only, making them available on-demand, to help free up space on the local device, or choose to always retain a synchronized copy locally.
-Files Restore. The OneDrive Files Restore feature enables users to restore files to any point over the past 30 days. Users can view a histogram and select any point in time they wish to roll back to.
-Recycle Bin. OneDrive has a recycle bin similar to the one available on the Windows desktop. Deleted files are moved to the recycle bin and kept for a designated time before being permanently deleted. For work or school accounts, deleted files are purged after 93 days unless configured otherwise.
-Auditing & Reporting. OneDrive has detailed reporting and auditing capabilities for files it stores as well as for those files stored through other services that use OneDrive for storage, such as Microsoft SharePoint. In addition, you can audit individual file actions, including downloads, renames, and views.
-Encryption of data in transit and at rest. At rest, OneDrive uses disk encryption through BitLocker Drive Encryption and file encryption to secure your data. Each file chunk is then randomly distributed among Microsoft Azure storage containers, making it highly improbably for attackers to access the file.

Accessing OneDrive
You can access it from any currently supported device, as well as through a web browser at http://www.OneDrive.com.
The OneDrive Sync client is already installed with Windows. OneDrive supports Windows 8.1 and higher, and the latest sync client can be installed from the download page of the OneDrive website. The OneDrive client is also available for supported versions of macOS, Android and iOS from their respective app stores.

Enable OneDrive
Before you can use OneDrive from the Windows OneDrive tile, you must connect your domain or local account with your Microsoft account. To begin the process, select the OneDrive item in the File Explorer console tree. You then will receive a prompt to sign in with your Microsoft account or to create an account if you do not have one.

To config synchronization:
Done as part of initial setup.

Restricting access to OneDrive
As an IT administrator, you might wish to prevent your users from accessing OneDrive from organizational systems. You can accomplish this by using Group Policy. In the appropriate GPO, go to the Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\OneDrive node, and enable the Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage policy setting.
If you need to block access to OneDrive for all devices, including users’ personal devices, you could create a URL block list on your organizational firewall.

Note - One Drive for Business used M365 cloud service. Otherwise cloud service is OneDrive.

Examine Work Folders (Windows Server)(Replaces Offline files)(Not a cloud solution)
With Work Folders users can store and access work files on personal computers and devices, often referred to as bring-your-own device (BYOD), in addition to corporate PCs. Users gain a convenient location to store work files, and they can access them from anywhere. Organizations maintain control over corporate data by storing the files on centrally managed file servers, and optionally specifying user device policies such as encryption and lock-screen passwords.
Work Folders stores user files in a folder on the server called a sync share. You can specify a folder that already contains user data, which enables you to adopt Work Folders without migrating servers and data or immediately phasing out your existing solution.

Components of Work Folders
If you want to use Work Folders, several components must be available in your environment:
-A Work Folders server. You need a file server that is running Windows Server 2016 or later. The file server must be a member of an Active Directory domain, and it must have the Work Folder role service installed, which is part of the File and Storage Services role. When you install the role service, this adds an additional access protocol and extends Server Manager. You can use Server Manager to create and manage sync shares, which contain users’ Work Folders. You also can use Server Manager to view who can access sync shares, when and from which devices users can access them, and to perform other tasks, such as setting quotas and managing volumes. Users can access and sync their Work Folders by using the HTTPS encapsulated access protocol. Synchronization uses https encryption, so the file server must have an installed Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate, and the devices from which users access the Work Folders must trust that certificate.
-A sync share. A sync share is a unit of synchronization between the Work Folders server and client devices. You can create multiple sync shares on a Work Folders server, and each sync folder maps to the physical folder on the file server. Each user who uses Work Folders has a personal subfolder inside the sync share, and users can access and sync only the content of their subfolders. Can configure device policies - like local copy encryption. Users can access single shares only.y default, you can access a sync share only by using the Work Folders feature, but an administrator also can create a Server Message Block (SMB) share that uses the same folder as a sync share. If users can access sync share content by using SMB access, they can view synced content from devices that do not use Work Folders. A file server stores the sync share, so you can use features such as dynamic access control, quotas, and file screening when managing the sync share’s content.
-User devices. These are the devices from which you can access, modify, and sync content that Work Folders are storing. You can access Work Folders from workgroup devices, devices that are workplace-joined, or domain-member devices.Windows client devices support Work Folders by default, and you can add Work Folders support to Android, iPad, and iPhone devices. Devices also must trust the SSL certificate that the Work Folders server is using. If you configure devices to use Work Folders, Windows detects the changes to the local copies of data, and then synchronizes them with the server. By default, devices check the Work Folders server every 10 minutes and sync changes with local copies of the Work Folders data.

Practical applications
Provide a single point of access to work files from a user's work and personal computers and devices
Access work files while offline, and then sync with the central file server when the PC or device next has Internet or intranet connectivity
Deploy with existing deployments of Folder Redirection, Offline Files, and home folders
Use existing file server management technologies, such as file classification and folder quotas, to manage user data
Specify security policies to instruct user's PCs and devices to encrypt Work Folders and use a lock screen password
Use Failover Clustering with Work Folders to provide a high-availability solution

Deploying Work Folders
-Obtain SSL certificates. Work Folders uses HTTPS to securely synchronize files between the Work Folders clients and the Work Folders server. The SSL certificates used by Work Folders must be issued by a trusted certification authority. For most Work Folders implementations, a publicly trusted CA is recommended, since certificates will be used by non-domain-joined, Internet-based devices.
-Create DNS records. To allow users to sync across the Internet, you must create a Host (A) record in public DNS to allow Internet clients to resolve your Work Folders URL. This DNS record should resolve to the external interface of the reverse proxy server. On your internal network, create a CNAME record in DNS named workfolders which resolves to the FDQN of a Work Folders server. When Work Folders clients use auto discovery, the URL used to discover the Work Folders server is https://workfolders.domain.com. If you plan to use auto discovery, the workfolders CNAME record must exist in DNS. Install Work Folders on file servers.
-Install Work Folders on file servers. You can install Work Folders on a domain-joined server by using Server Manager or by using Windows PowerShell, locally or remotely across a network. This is useful if you are configuring multiple sync servers across your network.
-Binding the SSL certificate on the sync servers. Work Folders installs the IIS Hostable Web Core, which is an IIS component designed to enable web services without requiring a full installation of IIS. After installing the IIS Hostable Web Core, you should bind the SSL certificate for the server to the Default Web Site on the file server. However, the IIS Hostable Web Core does not install the IIS Management console. There are two options for binding the certificate to the Default Web Interface. To use either option you must have installed the private key for the certificate into the computer's personal store.
-Create security groups for Work Folders. Before creating sync shares, a member of the Domain Admins or Enterprise Admins groups needs to create some security groups in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) for Work Folders. - one group per synch share, one group for Work Folders administrators.
-Optionally delegate user attribute control to Work Folders administrators. If you are deploying multiple sync servers and want to automatically direct users to the correct sync server, you'll need to update an attribute on each user account in AD DS. this normally requires getting a member of the Domain Admins or Enterprise Admins groups to update the attributes. a member of the Domain Admins or Enterprise Admins groups might want to delegate the ability to modify the msDS-SyncServerURL property of user objects to the Work Folders Administrators group you created in Step 5.
-Create sync shares for user data. At this point, you're ready to designate a folder on the sync server to store your user's files. This folder is called a sync share. Sync shares can be created using Server Manager or by using the New-SyncShare cmdlet in Windows PowerShell.
