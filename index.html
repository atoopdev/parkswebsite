        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        
        <p>Greetings and welcome to my election website for the Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District Board. I am Keir Bryerton, and I am excited to share my vision for the future of our community's beloved parks and recreational areas.</p>

        <p>Here, you will discover my perspectives on park issues that matter to me, such as financial management, community involvement, land use, and environmental impact. </p>
          
        <p>Also, please take a moment to explore the "About Me" section, where you can learn more about my background.</p>
          
         I would be honored to have the opportunity to serve our community as a board member. Thank you for your interest, and I look forward to earning your trust and support!</p>

         <p><span class="emphasis">Election Day is May 16, 2023.</span> <span class="underline">Ballots must be postmarked or dropped off by 8pm.</span></p>

        </div>
        <p>Everyone loves parks, but should that mean a 265% rate hike for one of the agencies that manages them? Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District has stated that they intend to ask voters for a permanent rate increase, from $0.34/1000 assessed value to $1.24/1000 assessed value. This is a permanent increase of 265%. <a href="financial.html">Read more...</a></p>

        </div>
      <p>I would like to see Parks and Rec decision making become more inclusive of the community and allow input beyond town hall meetings. If elected I would work to establish community advisory panels for all major projects. <a href="./community.html">Read more...</a></p>
