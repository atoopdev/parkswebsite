        </div>
        <p>Everyone loves parks, but should that mean a 265% rate hike for one of the agencies that manages them? Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District has stated that they intend to ask voters for a permanent rate increase, from $0.34/1000 assessed value to $1.24/1000 assessed value. This is a permanent increase of 265%. <a href="financial.html">Read more...</a></p>

      <p>I would like to see Parks and Rec decision making become more inclusive of the community and allow input beyond town hall meetings. If elected I would work to establish community advisory panels for all major projects. <a href="./community.html">Read more...</a></p>
