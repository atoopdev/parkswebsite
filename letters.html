          <p>To: mike.oates@hoodrivercounty.gov <mike.oates@hoodrivercounty.gov>,karen.joplin@hoodrivercounty.gov <karen.joplin@hoodrivercounty.gov>,arthur.babitz@hoodrivercounty.gov <arthur.babitz@hoodrivercounty.gov>,bob.benton@hoodrivercounty.gov <bob.benton@hoodrivercounty.gov>,les.perkins@hoodrivercounty.gov <les.perkins@hoodrivercounty.gov></p>
          <p>Cc:</p>
          
          <p>Dear Commissioners,</p> 
          
          <p>I am writing to you because I would like to start a conversation/offer testimony to the Hood River County Board of Commissioners about my experience living next to Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District’s RC flying field/ 
          Barrett Park.</p>
          
          <p>As I am sure you are aware, the BOC denied HRVPRD a conditional use permit to develop the property for a second time in December, 2013. 
          In Jan/Feb 2014, former parks district director Lori Stirn allowed the Columbia Gorge Aeromodelers, a private club, to install an RC runway at Barrett 85 feet from my property. So not only did Lori Stirn put an RC field in our neighborhood, she did it in the most disrespectful and invasive way possible.
          Then Lori Stirn planted two interpretive signs on the property, removed the gate at the entrance, and opened for business.</p>
          
          
          
          <p>My quality of life has been declining ever since. The noise and electronic harassment I experience as a result of this RC field has affected every facet of my life.  
          In recent years, I have experienced RC noise nearly every day, and I am often forced to wear earplugs or leave my property to get away from it. Every spring and summer weekend brings shrieking, invasive noise, often from morning till dusk.
          I can hear the RC noise inside my house.
          Camera equipped drones fly over my house.
          In addition, I have experienced theft, vandalism, trespassing, threats, intimidation, and vicious verbal abuse from visitors to the property. I have chased drug dealers and users off the property at a risk to myself. I have nearly been hit by a car speeding out of the property while walking down to my mailbox. My cat was hit on the access road by a non-authorized user in the middle of the night in October, 2020.</p>
          
          <p>Also since 2014, Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District has operated the property as an open space, off leash dog park, and rest area open to the public dawn to dusk/365 days a year. Night time activity is common.
          Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District uses the barn on the property as a maintenance shed and to store equipment used district wide.
          HRC County Planner Eric Walker confirmed to me in writing that all of these uses-public open space, off leash dog park, rest area, and maintenance shed-violate ORS 215.283, which outlines permitted uses on EFU zoned land. 
          Then Mr Walker told me in writing that he would not enforce ORS 215.283 in the case of Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District and Barrett Park. He only required a small sign at the entrance that restricts parking to RC hobbyists, not a gate. Of course, this sign is ignored by the public and Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District does not enforce it.</p>
          
          <p>Inline image</p>
          
          <p>Why does the fact there is one allowed use of the property occurring-a model aircraft flying field-allow Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District to open the property to the general public for NON-allowed uses dawn to dusk and beyond/365 days per year in violation of ORS 215.283?</p>
          
          <p>Why does public employee Eric Walker get to decide whether to enforce Oregon land use law?</p>
          
          <p>Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District also refuses to enforce any of their own posted rules on the property. Including those specific to the RC flying field. Over and over, they tell me to call the sheriff if there are issues, putting responsibility for policing the property on me, a private citizen. The sheriff’s department tells me they cannot enforce park rules or limit access to RC activities only.</p>
          
          <p>So Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District gets to have their park after all, despite not having the required conditional use permit, as they wait for a more favourable lineup at the HRC Board of Commissioners to green-light further development.</p>
          
          <p>I have made repeated and sustained attempts to appeal to both the Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation Board and management about how invasive and destructive this situation is to my life. </p>
          <p>I am either fobbed off with token fixes (like the sign), bullied by HRVPRD management, or ignored completely. </p>
          <p>I have extensive documentation of this situation including a written log, hundreds of photographs, videos, and all of the correspondence with HRVPRD and Eric Walker.</p>
          <p>I have recently started a YouTube channel:</p> 
          
          <p>https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCqOvnK0lYBXJ9yHJuGeer5A</p>
          
          <p>I have demonstrated to HRVPRD that their property doesn’t even meet field size guidelines published by the Academy of Model Aeronautics for the kind of planes flown there. </p>
          <p>They don’t care. </p>
          <p>There is zero oversight of the hobbyists. </p>
          <p>They have unfettered access to the property. </p>
          <p>Including the airspaces of neighbors and the out of bounds areas.</p>
          
          <p>I am a long time HRC resident, a hardworking journeyman electrician, a taxpayer and a voter, yet Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District has shown zero respect to me as either a resident and private property owner or as a human being. 
          I did not “move to the situation,” an argument some RC hobbyists have used to shut down the complaints of one my neighbors. My residency at this location predated HRVPRD purchasing the former orchard next to me. My parents bought my property in 1977.
          Nevertheless, I am told that if I don’t like the noise I shouldn’t live next to an RC field.
          I am told that they will fly “when and where they want” and I will “take it.”</p>
          
          <p>I have found nowhere else in Oregon where a public RC flying field open dawn to dusk/365 days per year has been installed in a residential area 85 feet from a neighboring property. Only HRVPRD is so callous. 
          Even the Academy of Model Aeronautics recommends considering sound sensitivity and proximity to neighbors when selecting a flying site.
          Situating an RC field immediately adjacent to established residences is wrong. 
          Subjecting residents to flyovers and surveillance with camera equipped drones is wrong.
          Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District came into our neighborhood with no respect for our lives or rights as private property owners. Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District has made this an ugly place to live.
          Are these Hood River County values?
          Is this how special districts supported by tax dollars should treat hard working residents?</p>
          
          <p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with you or answer any questions you might have. </p>
          <p>Thank you for your time and attention.</p>
          
          <p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Rep. Williams,</p> 

<p>As it is April (2022), I am wondering if you have had a chance to do any follow through with the Office of Legislative Counsel about RC flying fields on EFU zoned land.
I am aware that you are not seeking re-election, so maybe this issue is no longer relevant to you, but thought I’d check in about it.
I have started a YouTube channel where I publish the reality of this situation. 
Maybe it is abstract to you. Maybe seeing it will provide more clarity.</p>

Hello Keir,</p>

 

<p>I apologize that I didn’t get back to you – I remember responding to your first email about a year ago, but don’t recall seeing one since then. I’ve reviewed it now (thanks for including it here), as well as this update and all the impressive research that went into it.</p>

 

<p>I’ll reach out to a couple of folks in the city to see where they’re coming from in allowing this use. I’ve actually been in touch with some folks from HRVPRD about an unrelated matter recently (though it, too, involved Barrett Park), so I’ll follow up with them about this. I’ll also try to find time to talk to an attorney in the Office of Legislative Counsel about the weeds of this proposed change, and whether there might be different paths toward meeting the same goal: protecting the quality of life of Oregonians living near properties used for these purposes. I’ll note, though, that they and I are very focused on the demanding schedule of a short legislative session right now, so if you haven’t heard any updates from me by the end of the session (March 8th at the latest, though we may wrap up before then), please reach out again. With so many issues confronting Oregonians, and so many bills presently being considered to address those issues, I have pretty limited capacity in the next few weeks. Still, I’m happy to see how I can help on this matter!</p>

 

<p>My best,</p>

<p>Subject: Fw: ORS 215.283/RC flying fields</p>

 

<p>CAUTION: This email originated from outside the Legislature. Use caution clicking any links or attachments.</p>

 

 

<p>Dear Rep. Williams,</p> 

 

<p>On 6 June, 2021, I sent you the email forwarded below regarding the RC flying field managed by Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District and my suggestion to change the relevant section of ORS 215.283 to make the law more fair and equitable to adjacent property owners.</p> 

 

<p>Since I never received a reply to this email or any acknowledgement that it was received, I would like to ask whether it was received or not. I am sending this email from a different account because I wonder if yahoo has delivery issues.</p>

 

<p>I would like you to know that I have done more research on the issue at http://www.oregonlegislature.gov.</p>

 

<p>1) ORS 215.283 was changed to allow model aircraft flying fields in 1997, not in the mid-aughts like I remembered from the newspaper article. The bill was sponsored by Sen. Bill Fisher (R-Roseberg) as SB 0395. Sen. Bill Fisher seems to have been the primary driver of this legislation. A house version of the bill was introduced as HB 3425 and was sponsored by Rep. Thomas Whelan (D-Salem) with four additional Oregon state representatives signing on. Those four representatives were: Dan Gardner (D-Portland), Bryan Johnston (D-Salem), Frank Shields (D-Portland), and Charles Starr (R-Hillsboro). </p>

<p>It is not clear to me whether SB 0395 passed as a stand alone bill or whether it was attached to another bill and passed as a rider. However, just a couple of years later, other legislators were trying to address the inequity of it.</p>

<p>I have included links to SB 0395 and HB 3425 below.</p> 

 

<p>Senate Bill 0395 - Introduced</p>

 

<p>Senate Bill 0395 - Introduced</p>
 

 

<p>House Bill 3425 - Introduced</p>

 

<p>House Bill 3425 - Introduced</p>
 

 

 

<p>2) In 2001, Sen. Rick Metsger (D-Clackamas) introduced SB 48, which I have linked below. This bill would have prohibited any RC flying field to be located within 1000 from the boundary of an adjacent property. The exact language of the proposal was:</p>

 

<p>A surface used for takeoff and landing of model aircraft must not be located within 1,000 feet of the property boundary of an adjacent property owner. The oper- ator of a model aircraft taking off from or landing on the site may not fly the model aircraft over the property of any adjacent property owner, unless the adjacent property owner has given written consent. Written consent may be revoked.</p>

 

<p>If you recall, Rep. Williams, Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District located their RC flying field less than 100 feet from my property line.</p> 

 

<p>SB 48 did not progress past its introduction in the Senate. I have included the link to this bill below.</p>

 

<p>https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/archivebills/2001_SB48.pdf</p>

 

 

 

 

<p>3) On 26 August, 2003, Rep. Phil Barnhart (D-Eugene) and Rep. Laurie Monnes Anderson (D-Gresham) introduced an amendment to SB 915 that sought to change

 

"authorization to use land in exclusive farm use zone for takeoff and landing of model aircraft from outright permitted authorization to conditional authorization."</p>

 

<p>This amendment seems to have been accepted into SB 915, but SB 915 appears to have stalled.</p> 

<p>I read Rep. Barnhart and Rep. Monnes Anderson's amendment carefully, and they seem to have overlooked the distinction between marginal and non-marginal lands when trying to make RC flying fields a conditional use in exclusive farm use zones. </p>

<p>ORS 215.213 addresses land use in exclusive farm use zones on marginal lands. "Marginal lands" refers to counties that adopted the provisions of the now defunct Marginal Lands Act.</p>

<p>In 1983, the Oregon legislature adopted the Marginal Lands Act. Lane and Washington counties were the only Oregon counties that signed onto the marginal lands program, and ORS 215.213 applies to them.</p>

<p>In all other Oregon counties, land use on EFU zoned land is governed by ORS 215.283.</p> 

<p>In their amendment to change RC flying fields from an outright use on EFU to a conditional one, Rep. Barnhart and Rep. Monnes Anderson only amended ORS 215.213, and neglected to also change 215.283.</p> 

<p>Since their summary did not make the distinction, I wonder if this might have been an oversight.</p> 

<p>I have linked to the bill below.</p>

 

<p>https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/archivebills/2003_MRBESB915.pdf</p>

 

 

<p>Although neither the 2001 or 2003 bills became law, the existence of those bills shows that a few Oregon legislators recognized early on that proximity to RC flying fields could cause harm to others.</p> 

<p>Fast forward to 2014, and Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation district does just that, with absolutely no consideration then or now for the Hood River residents whose lives are adversely affected on a daily basis by their "park."</p>

 

<p>Frankly, I was disappointed in your comment to me that you are hesitant to start adjusting our EFU regulations. Bill Fisher obviously had no such reservations. Isn't his amendment to Oregon land use law the original can of worms here? Why should RC flying fields be allowed outright on EFU zoned land? What do they have to do with farmland or agriculture? Why should Bill Fisher's amendment be sacrosanct to you or anyone else if it harms other Oregonians?</p> 

 

<p>Rep. Williams, I am a longtime Hood River resident. I am a union electrician, a taxpayer, and an enthusiastic voter. I am a lifelong Democrat who voted for you twice and even had lawn signs. I am a considerate person and a person of integrity. If my quality of life was not being trampled by HRVPRD, do you think I would be expending so much of my time on this?</p>

 

<p>Please read the proposed amendments I have linked to and consider whether taken together, they might provide a more equitable solution than leaving ORS 215.213 and ORS 215.283 as they stand now.</p> 

 

 

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Subject: Re: ORS 215.283/RC flying fields</p>

 

<p>Dear Rep. Williams,</p>

 

 

<p>Thank you for your response. I apologize for my delay in following up. With my work schedule, it can be hard for me to find the time to write detailed emails like this. Please know that the delay in no way reflects abatement of the problem or any lessened intent in addressing it with you further.</p> 

 

<p>I can appreciate a reluctance to change established land use regulations, but I wonder if you are aware of the specific history of how RC flying fields became an outright allowed use on EFU land in Oregon.</p>

<p>News stories about this amendment seem to have disappeared from the internet, so what I relate at this time will be from memory. I will have to contact the legislative historian in Salem to get the specific bill and parties involved for you. I did not find a way to easily search for that information online.</p>

<p>RC flying became codified in Oregon law as an outright allowed use on EFU sometime in the mid-aughts. I believe it was added/snuck into an unrelated bill (a budget bill, if my memory serves) by a GOP legislator as a special favour to a constituent, a Willamette Valley landowner/farmer. Obviously, given the language of the amendment as it stands now, attention was not paid by lawmakers to possible negative ramifications (i.e. noise pollution, flyovers, and surveillance of adjacent landowners by camera-equipped drones). I would doubt meaningful debate about this amendment occurred at all. Flying RC aircraft and drones on expansive privately owned farmland in the Willamette Valley is a very different situation than doing so in West Hood River, which as you know is comprised of small farms and residential properties.</p> 

<p>I am not sure why the legislator and their constituent felt it was necessary to add the amendment at all, unless the constituent was flying near other farms/residences and getting pushback from neighbors or they wanted to install a permanent facility for a club serving multiple users that could potentially be reported. Ultimately, given this history, I believe the RC flying field amendment was itself a questionable adjustment to EFU regulations, and it should not be off-limits for further adjustment to make it more equitable. Fundamentally, i believe it is in the interest of all Oregonians that laws protecting agricultural land be as strong and comprehensive as possible. Relaxing those laws to allow recreational hobbies is at odds with that goal.</p> 

 

<p>Questions of land use aside, this is also about the right of Oregonians to live in their homes and enjoy their property without electronic/technological harassment from RC hobbyists. It is not right that people should have to wear earplugs while they’re at home to block out RC noise or be worried that a drone is watching them while they’re in their own yard. It is an egregious invasion of privacy, and environmental noise pollution has been proven to be harmful to both physical and mental health. There is also the fact that property values can be diminished by such activity in near proximity. As it stands now, ORS 215.283 gives more rights to RC hobbyists flying on a public/multi-user field than to neighbouring property owners/residents who live on/near EFU land. My intention is not to prohibit RC activities; it is to ask the Oregon legislature to recognize that these activities are invasive/harmful to others when located in close vicinity to neighbouring properties, and provide safeguards to prevent this from happening in the future.</p> 

 

 

<p>Honestly, I think RC flying fields should be a conditional use on EFU land, subject to the same permitting requirements and oversight as parks, playgrounds, and golf courses. However, a fair and reasonable compromise would be to introduce restrictions into the law as written. This is why I suggest that if RC flying remains an outright allowed use on EFU, ORS 215.283 should be amended to include a minimum distance that destination RC flying fields* can be installed from established structures meant for habitation or commerce. I guess the actual distance would be a matter of debate, and could be discussed further. The distance would need to be sufficient so that nearby residents could not hear RC noise in their yards. Allowing closer proximity based on type of UAV (electric, for instance) is not a tenable option. People do not always follow rules, and it’s a misnomer that electric UAVs are silent. They are not. Many are very loud, physically painful to the ears, and the noise is localized as opposed to transitory. </p>

<p>I think neighboring properties would be more protected from the air traffic/flyovers/drone surveillance originating from a nearby RC field if there was a mandated buffer distance. Drone surveillance that does not originate from an RC flying field is a separate issue.</p>

 

<p>(*Again, I am distinguishing between a destination flying field and a property owner flying a UAV on their own property. I think the term ‘destination flying field’ would describe:</p>

 

<p>1. A flying field installed on public land.</p>

<p>2. A flying field that is the official field of a AMA (Academy of Model Aeronautics) club.</p> 

<p>3. A flying field that is open to the public at large.)</p>

 

 

<p>I have considered contacting the DLCD about HRVPRD’s operation of the Barrett property as a de facto open space/public park/park storage and maintenance facility without possessing the necessary permit that allows these uses, but so far have not done so. I have been planning to write to the HRC BOC first.</p> 

<p>Do you think this a situation that DLCD might take under consideration? Would they (or any other agency) have any ability to address the RC issue without ORS 215.283 first being amended through the legislative process?</p> 

<p>Regardless of whether a situation like this can be resolved locally (please see addendum below), I think it’s unfortunate that Oregon land use law allowed it to surface at all.</p> 

 

<p>I thank you for your time and attention.</p>

<p>Addendum on specific situation with HRVPRD:</p>

 

<p>I know you are busy, and I really don’t want to overwhelm you with extraneous details about this situation. However, as you mentioned that this should be able to be resolved locally, I will share a little more of my experience with HRVPRD.</p>

 

<p>I agree with you that this should be an issue that could be resolved among affected parties, which is why, until now, I have appealed to HRVPRD, its board members, and Eric Walker at the HRC Planning Department, which is responsible for enforcing Oregon land use laws in HRC. These efforts span years, and are well documented in many emails, attendance at meetings, and comments given into the public record. I have invested much time in this that I will never recover. Unfortunately, HRVPRD is unwilling to compromise at all. Their position is that Oregon law gives them the absolute right: RC flying fields are an outright allowed use on EFU; no restrictions. I have been told by employees of HRVPRD and by RC hobbyists that if I don’t like it, I should move or leave my property when they are flying. I have been called names by RC hobbyists and had derogatory comments directed at me if I confront them about the noise or their noncompliance with posted rules. Though we’d all hope that a local municipality wouldn’t treat us this way, there it is. As I alluded to in my previous email, HRVPRD has never once shown any consideration or sensitivity to the people who live next to/nearby the Barrett property. Every year the problem gets worse. I renewed my case to the HRVPRD Board in October 2019, with a emailed letter, thinking that with a new director and a mostly new board, the issue might be revisited. Four of the five board members did not acknowledge my letter and the fifth (Mike McCarthy) responded, but lost interest quickly. Discussions and emails with HRVPRD Director Mark Hickok and an in-person meeting with Heather Staten in attendance as an ally/observer offered no resolution. My neighbor, who lives at the corner of Alameda Road and Barrett Drive, followed up with a polite, well-considered letter in October 2020, outlining years of noise, flyovers and verbal abuse from RC hobbyists, and received the same dismissive treatment. Mark Hickok emailed her the contact information for the RC club, so my neighbor could deal with it herself. To HRVPRD, the people who live adjacent to the property simply don’t matter. That is my experience, at least.</p> 

 

<p>During a recent visit to the property, Mark Hickok made the following comments/justifications for inaction to me:</p>

 

<p>1. The RC hobbyists pay taxes and are entitled to a flying field provided by HR County taxpayers (Nevermind that neighbors of the Barrett Park property also pay taxes. And nevermind the fact that HRVPRD is failing to provide free facilities for all HRC taxpayers to engage in their preferred hobby.)</p>

<p>2. Limited hours are not an option because all HRVPRD parks are open dawn to dusk/365 days per year.</p> 

<p>3. This is not unlike or any worse than noise from ball games or the airport, so I don’t have any grounds for complaint.</p> 

<p>4. Mark Hickok and the current Board are not responsible for the situation because most of them were not in their positions when the decision to install an RC flying field was made.</p>

<p>5. Although members of the HRVPRD Board achieve their positions through the democratic process and are elected by HRC voters, they are not obliged to respond to direct correspondence or engage with us in any way. Mark Hickok handles all public relations for for HRVPRD.</p>

<p>6. If we experience verbal abuse or threatening behavior from RC hobbyists, HRVPRD is not responsible and it might not have happened as we claim. HRVPRD has also denied responsibility for enforcing its own posted flying rules and other posted rules at the property, and put the burden for this on neighbors by telling us to call the sheriff if we have issues.</p>

<p>Dear Keir,</p>

 

<p>Thanks you for reaching out about this issue. I have heard about this as one of the ongoing points of conflict between the RC community and the local residents in our area. I am always hesitant to start adjusting our EFU regulations, as it’s a bit of a can of worms that can create more problems than it solves. That said, if you have specific suggestions for how to update the ORS 215.283 to address your concerns, please send them to me. It’s too late to propose any bills to address your concern this session, but if I have a clearer understanding of your proposed solution, I may be able to direct you to someone at DLCD or another state agency who can connect with you about this concern. In general, this feels like a local issue which should be solved by local conversations between HRVPRD, local landusers, and local residents.</p>

 

<p>Thanks again for reaching out about this. I appreciate hearing from members of my community about the issues that are important to them. Do not hesitate to reach out about anything else you may like to discuss.

<p>Subject: ORS 215.283/RC flying fields</p>

 

<p>Dear Rep. Williams,</p> 

 

<p>My name is Keir Bryerton and I am a longtime resident of West Hood River.</p> 

 

<p>I am writing to you about the amendment to ORS 215.283 which permits radio-controlled aircraft flying fields and landing strips in exclusive farm use (EFU) zones. This amendment includes no restriction about now close RC flying fields can be located to existing residences and other relevant structures/properties, and the oversight is having real consequences for some of us  in Hood River County.</p> 

 

<p>As you may be aware, Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District installed a RC flying field and landing strip at the Barrett Park property at 4010 Barrett Drive in 2014. As a few people had been flying RC planes and helicopters on the property in the years before the official flying field opened, I was aware of how loud and invasive the RC noise could be and objected strenuously to this usage. HRVPRD ignored my concerns, and performed no comprehensive survey/study as how this usage would affect other nearby residents and the neighbourhood at large. In fact, although the property is 30+ acres, HRVPRD installed their landing strip 30 yards from my property and 45 yards from my neighbor’s property, a distance Thrive Hood River/Hood River Resident’s Committee describes on their website as “inappropriately close.” (www.thrivehoodriver.org/barrett-property-park/)</p>

 

<p>For years now, people in our neighbourhood have been adversely affected by noise, flyovers, and surveillance by camera-equipped drones hovering over our properties. The property is continuously open, 365 days/year for RC activities and other non-authorized activities (Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District does not have a conditional use permit that allows activities other than RC flying, but they are routinely allowed to occur anyway). The impact of this flying field on my quality of life and enjoyment of my property has been persistent and profound to the extent that I cannot consider long-term occupancy/investment in my property as a viable option. I am saddened and outraged that the right of myself and my neighbors to peace and quiet on our own properties is superseded one hundred percent by a more powerful neighbor taking advantage of a poorly considered amendment to Oregon land use law.</p>

 

<p>Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District is well aware of all of these issues, but refuses to mitigate the situation in any way (limited flying hours, for example or even enforcing their own posted rules). In addition, Hood River County Planning Department refuses to make HRVPRD curtail non-authorized use on the property, a situation which amounts to HRVPRD lawyers and Hood River County civil servants deciding that HRVPRD is not subject to Oregon land use laws.</p> 

 

<p>I believe that in the interest of fairness and respect for all Oregonians who may be affected by this in the future, ORS 215.283 needs to be amended to prevent public/private destination RC flying fields from being installed in the immediate vicinity of existing residences/inhabited properties if there is opposition from adjacent property owners. Obviously, there is a difference between a public/private destination RC flying field and someone flying a RC plane in their own backyard.</p> 

 

<p>Please consider this issue, and if you have any questions please email or call me at (503) 805-4376. I would welcome the opportunity to talk with you about this issue further. I have included a few additional links below for reference.</p>

<p>Also, congratulations and best wishes for your second term in office.</p> 

 

<p>Sincerely,</p> 

 

<p>Keir Bryerton</p> 

<p>Hood River</p>

<p>Subject: RE: Comments on the Barrett Property/KB</p>

<p>Mark and Keir-</p>

 

<p>First of all, thanks to you both for reaching out to the Planning Department and for seeking additional insight and clarification to my earlier email, which in all fairness was a bit terse given our ongoing workload. I should have taken the time to provide a more thoughtful responses and greater details. That said however, I would like to make it clear that the County Planning Department is unable to serve as a mediator for this ongoing conflict. If verifiable and egregious violations occur, we will investigate and, if necessary, pursue enforcement action, but we will not respond to minor day-to-day issues, such as someone running their dog off-leash or wandering off the trail to have a picnic. Therefore, I would again invite you both to sit down and have an open conversation about how to address each other’s primary concerns. I think there is plenty of room to provide reasonable solutions that are effective and positive to both sides.</p>

 

<p>Now to your questions, the Park District is authorized to use the property for a trail and an RC Flyer Field. No other formal recreational uses have been authorized. As owner of the property, the Park District is ultimately responsible to ensure that it is used in a manner that conforms to the requirements of the County Zoning Ordinance, the conditions of its permit, and any other requirements/laws in effect regarding the use of the property. However, we also understand that 100% compliance, every day is unrealistic given that the property is made open and available to the public, who may not entirely know or care about the restrictions on how the property is used. We do not expect the Park District to hire a security guard to monitory the property 24/7, but do believe that some strategic efforts could be made to minimize unauthorized use of the property and conflicts, such as the following:</p>

 

<p>(1) sign the property in a way that clearly and effectively communicates the appropriate/authorized use of the property;</p>

<p>(2) preclude any messaging, advertising, or the like that would explicitly or implicitly encourage public use of the property beyond its approved use as a trail and RC Flyer Field;</p>

<p>(3) avoid managing the grounds in any way that would invite unpermitted activities; and</p>

<p>(4) monitor the property, as practicable, and if necessary empower Park District employees to discourage unauthorized activities when witnessed, as they would at any other Park District facility.</p>

 

<p>In response to your other questions below (Keir’s original questions/comments are in black, Mark’s comments are in blue, Keir’s later comments are in green, and my original comments are in red, while my latest responses are in bolded/underlined red):</p>

<p>-Hiking to the trail (Order P-09-0296 allowing the trail specifically states that no parking lot serving the trail will be provided, implying further permitting would be needed to establish any parking area. I realize that this order was written before the orchard was removed, but I wonder if you could clarify on whether the parking lot serving the RC field is allowed to also serve as the parking lot for the trail). The parking area developed to serve the RC flyer field was not approved for use as a trailhead for the Indian Creek Trail. The entrance to the parking area is currently signed “Radio Control Flier Entrance” and fifty feet later there are two signs that state “Spectator area, and Flyer Area”.  Does the county have an expectation that the parks district monitors the parking area a regulates the use of patrons who park there? Although I think the existing signing is fine, as it does not encourage improper parking, I think it could be improved by having the sign simply say “Parking for Radio Control Flyers and Spectators Only. All Other Parking Prohibited,” or something similar. If necessary, you could also add some standard tow warning signs, which might further emphasize the restrictions on parking.</p>   

<p>-Off leash dog park/dog park for individuals not utilizing the RC field. Not approved. There are at least six signs on the property that state dogs must be on leash.</p>

<p>Regardless of how many signs there are, HRVPRD does not have a permit to operate a dog park on the property. Increasingly, people come to the property solely to exercise their dogs and park in the RC parking lot. Some people come every day. These people are not RC operators, a distinction I sought to make in my original sentence.</p> 

<p>100% of the dogs I see on the property are exercised off leash. The property does not have the fencing necessary for a dog park, and trespass by visiting dogs is increasing. This Saturday, my cat was nearly chased into Barrett Drive by a visiting dog while I watched from my roof. Less than a week earlier, a pack of visiting dogs chased my cat through my property. These are just the instances I have seen, and they are unacceptable. I think the signing that already exists related to leashing dogs is fine. As you mentioned Mark, it may be appropriate/necessary to complete the fence started around Keir’s property as another way to minimize the types of issues described. Not a requirement, but it might be worth discussing further with Keir as another potential remedy.</p>

 

<p>-Day use recreation area for parking, picnicking, frisbee, car repair, restroom use, etc. by individuals not utilizing the RC field.  Not approved. If someone is walking the trail and they decide to have a picnic or throw a frisbee, does the county have an expectation that HRVPRD should tell them to leave? Technically, as property owner, you are responsible for how the property is used. Although the Planning Department has no intention of enforcing against minor, occasional infractions, it does expect that the Park District take reasonable steps, such as those listed above (Items 1-4), to discourage unauthorized activities.</p>

<p>Most of the non-RC affiliated use of this property does not involve people accessing the property from the trail. It involves people entering the property by car from Barrett Drive.</p>

 

<p>-Occurrences of overnight camping and a wedding.  Not approved. Overnight Camping is not allowed in any of our parks and in thirteen years of ownership there has only been one wedding which was held without our permission.</p>

<p>As HRVPRD continues to publish material that promotes the property as a public park/open space and the property is recognized as such, these kind of occurrences will only increase. The proximity of the parking lot to my property makes overnight camping/parking of particular concern to me. I looked at the Park District’s website and did not see anything written that would overtly promote Barrett Park for unauthorized uses, especially weddings and overnight camping.</p>  

 

<p>-Permanent interpretative signs welcoming the general public to the property.  Not approved. I’ve attached a picture of our interpretive signage that explains the parks district’s history with the property (a question that frequently comes up). It is consistent with other interpretive signage in our parks system. Given that the radio flyer field is an allowable use, do you see an issue with this sign? Although the sign seems historically accurate, the last paragraph is not ideal, especially the part that says… “Local residents and visitors who come to the area to experience the natural bounties of the Hood River Valley are invited to enjoy the open space and scenic vistas at Barrett Park…” In my opinion, this statement does not align with item 2 above as it seems to implicitly encourage use of the property beyond just walking the trail or flying an RC aircraft. Some wordsmithing, or outright removal of this paragraph, is recommended to eliminate all doubt. </p> 

<p>HRVPRD has a second permanent sign for the RC field next to this sign outlining property rules and flying protocol. There is third sign attached to the fence which largely replicates the information in the second sign.</p>

<p>HRVPRD has no signs on the property that say "No public access," or "Closed to public use" Instead, the last sentence of the first interpretive sign in the photo is: "Local residents and and visitors who come to the area to experience the natural bounties of the Hood River Valley are invited to enjoy the open space and scenic vistas at Barrett Park, and envision its eventual transformation into a more varied community recreation space."</p>

 

<p>-Promoting the property as an open space open to the public.  Not approved.</p>

 

<p>-Using the barn as the District's maintenance workshop and equipment storage facility serving the District at large.  Not approved. Is storing and maintaining mowing equipment, and a tractor that are primarily used at Barrett Park allowed? Yes.</p>

<p>HRVPRD may intend to limit usage of the barn thus going forward, but from my observation it has been used in a wider capacity since HRVPRD acquired the property. </p>

<p>The property is largely mowed by a contractor. The smaller mowing equipment used by HRVPRD seems to be used districtwide as HRVPRD employees tow it in and out of the property on a trailer. </p>

<p>Good morning Keir.</p>

<p>Thank you for your email and notifying the Planning Department of your concerns.</p>

<p>You are correct that the County Planning Dept is the agency responsible for ensuring permit compliance. However, in this instance, the permit conditions that you site below, which originated from Land Use Permit #14-0054, were actually revoked soon after the permit was issued in 2014 after it was determined that a radio flyer field is an outright allowed land use in the Exclusive Farm Use (EFU) zone per Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) 215.283(1)(q). By law, a local jurisdiction cannot impose additional restrictions or further regulate such uses. (For more information, see attached documents.) </p> 

<p>For these reasons, the Planning Department has no authority to compel the Park District to comply with the conditions listed in your email. Consequently, I would encourage you to continue to work with the HRVPRD staff and Board to seek resolution of the concerns raised.</p>

<p>Sorry that I am unable to assist you at this time.</p>

<p>Subject: Comments on the Barrett Property</p>


<p>To The Hood River Parks and Recreation District Board:</p>




	<p>This letter regards the usage and management of the HRVPRD’s Barrett property at 4010 Barrett Drive, Hood River. I intend to address what I have experienced and observed at the site as an adjacent property owner and how HRVPRD has managed the property and responded to concerns. I will organize this letter after the conditions of the 2014 land use permit allowing the radio-controlled flyer field and comment on how HRVPRD has failed to meet the conditions of that permit.</p>



<p>Permit condition 4:</p>
<p>A minimum 35-foot vision clearance triangle shall be provided at the intersection of the approved access driveway serving the facility and Barrett Drive (“Access B”). Within the vision clearance area, no structure shall be placed or vegetation allowed to grow between 3 and 8 feet above the ground, excluding utility poles and tree trunks.</p>


<p>Permit condition 5:</p>

<p>Driveway “B” is approved as the access serving the proposed radio flyer field. Driveway “A” however, may continue to be used as temporary access to the filed until Driveway “B” is completed.</p>

        <p>Permit condition 4 has not been met. HRVPRD continues to use Driveway “A”, which is a shared access point with my property and runs along my east property line. HRVPRD cannot maintain the required 35-foot vision triangle westward on Barrett Drive at this access point because the west half of the triangle lies on my property and there is vegetation in that location. Permit condition 5 notes that Driveway “A” may be used as temporary access, however 5 years cannot be considered “temporary” and to date no steps have been taken to install Access “B.” I believe Access “B” was included as a condition of the permit for safety reasons, as it would allow an unobstructed view of Barrett Drive in both directions, but I will also mention that continued use of Access “A” has had a negative impact on my property, since what was formerly a private orchard access point is now a public road.</p>



<p>Permit condition 7:</p> 

<p>It is the owner’s responsibility to ensure that noise generated at the proposed facility does not exceed maximum decibel levels, which are enforced though the County Noise Ordinance (attached).</p>

        <p>I have visited online forums for RC enthusiasts and discussions about noise complaints from neighbors are a frequent topic. Often, forum participants speak of housing developments overtaking an established RC field located at the edge of a town and how they are forced to contend with noise complaints from the new residents of the area. In this case, HRVPRD allowed the individuals or club responsible for installing the RC flyer field on the Barrett property to locate it nearly as close as possible to adjacent established properties, thereby introducing a foreign noise to long-term neighbors. Although I repeatedly voiced my concerns about an increase in noise in advance of this permit being granted, no consideration was given to those concerns when the present location of the flyer field was allowed. Former director Lori Stirn did assure me gas-powered aircraft would not be allowed. That was untrue; current director Mark Hickok told me that they are allowed. Gas-powered RC aircraft have a noise level of 85-100 dB(A) at 20 feet. This is non-compliant with the county noise ordinance. Gas-powered or not, many RC aircraft are loud and/or painfully high-pitched. The noise can be intrusive enough that I can hear it in my house and am often obliged to wear earplugs to deaden the sound. I have downloaded the NIOSH Sound Level Meter app on my iPhone, and noise from the flyer field regularly exceeds the 65 dB(A) allowed from 7 am-10 pm per the county ordinance at a distance of roughly 100 feet. This is five times the benchmark distance of 20 feet noted in the county ordinance. I questioned Mark Hickok about enforcement of the county noise ordinance and was told that HRVPRD was not able provide enforcement for the Barrett property. This statement is at odds with the requirements of permit condition 7, which clearly states that HRVPRD is responsible for monitoring and addressing noise on the property.</p>



<p>Permit condition 8:</p>             									                                                                                                            <p>To help minimize noise, trespass, and other potential impacts to nearby residential and farm uses, it is recommended that screening vegetation be planted between the proposed runway and surrounding properties, especially Tax Lots 1600 and 1700 (2N]OE 3C), as shown on your tentative approved landscape plan.</p>

        <p>This condition/recommendation has not been met for myself (tax lot 1600) or my neighbor (tax lot 1700). We are the two neighbors most impacted by the RC flyer field. HRVPRD has provided screening vegetation planted on District property for the other two adjacent properties (tax lots 1500 and 1900) which are minimally affected by the RC flyer field. In particular, former director Lori Stirn and former assistant director Scott Baker provided their friends (tax lot 1500) a generous buffer planted on District property down their west property line using in part trees transplanted from the 4010 property. I was never contacted about a buffer or told it would be okay for me to plant trees on District property along my north property line. In fact, I was told by Scott Baker that I was “lucky” that they had left me the fruit trees planted on my own property. HRVPRD also provided fencing to adjacent property owners along the Indian Creek trail, including tax lot 1900. I question if whether the failure of HRVPRD to extend the courtesy of a buffer/fencing to myself and my neighbors (tax lot 1700) is reprisal for speaking out against the park and the fact my neighbors declined the land swap former director Lori Stirn repeatedly sought from them. I raised these issues with Park Director Mark Hickok during a conversation in May 2019, and received no follow up. To date, no action has been taken to install this recommended buffer.</p>
        <p>There have been instances of trespass in the past five years, including the theft of an aluminum tripod ladder I had left midway up my back field after pruning the fruit trees. The ladder cost 200 dollars to replace. Littering and trespass by off-leash dogs has also occurred and I have been approached and verbally attacked while I was out in my yard for my opposition to the flyer field.</p>



<p>Permit condition 12:</p>											                                                                                                    <p>The facilities approved as part of this application are intended to accommodate radio control flyers only. The Park District is responsible to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to restrict other, non-authorized recreational use of the subject property, including but not limited to hikers using the onsite parking area to access the Indian Creek Trail.</p>

        <p>This condition has not been met and is not being met. Non-authorized use occurs multiple times daily, with hikers to the trail and dog walkers being the least frequent and most benign violators. People routinely drive back and park (usually during daytime hours, but sometimes at night). People come to repair their cars, play their stereos, use the bathroom, turn with excess speed in the gravel and peel out, and have tailgate parties. There have been overnight campers, obliging me to call the police. Over the past year, the parking lot and barn has become an exchange site for drugs for a group of individuals. There was a wedding in early May. In violation of this condition, HRVPRD advertises the property as a recreational destination and open space in county literature and on their website. There is no signage restricting usage and Director Mark Hickok told me that the property is open to the public for recreation, though events like weddings are not allowed. Permit condition 12 shows that this statement is not true. According to their permit, HRVPRD is responsible for restricting access to the Barrett property to RC flyers only. They should not be advertising or including the Barrett property as a “park” open to the public. The trail should only be accessed via the outlets on Alameda Drive and Barrett Drive. I will add here that people do sometimes leave their cars on Barrett Drive to access the trail, which creates a traffic hazard. Barrett Drive does not have shoulders wide enough to accommodate vehicle parking.</p>



        <p>Apart from HRVPRD’s failure to comply with the permit in the ways I outlined above, there is additionally the failure to comply with their own posted rules and generally behave as a good neighbor.</p>												                                                  
        <p>One issue I brought up with Mark Hickok is the fact that, although they have acres to the north, the operators habitually fly south of the posted no-fly zone, i.e. over my property and south of the barn. One time I was working in my yard and realized that a drone was hovering above me, watching. A clear violation of privacy and decency, to be spied on with drones. Upon confronting the operators, I found three men watching the monitor. I have in my possession another camera-equipped drone that had been flown into one of the trees on my property, and recently fell to the ground. Another operator left multiple flags for his obstacle course lying on the ground in the no-fly zone south of the barn for many weeks (he laid them down rather than picking them up and returning them to his car). I called Mark Hickok about this recurrent violation of the no-fly zone and no action was taken. He did not follow up with me, and the violation continued until the flags were removed by the individual contracted to mow the property. Posted rules at the property state that if such violations occur, flying privileges could be lost. I also brought up to Mark Hickok the fact that people visit the property outside of the posted open hours. Usually this involves people sitting in their cars in the parking lot or the aforementioned drug exchanges, but people sometimes also operate RC aircraft at night.</p>		 
        <p>Point blank, I was informed by Mark Hickok that it is not HRVPRD’s job to enforce posted rules, that they don’t have the manpower to enforce posted rules or close the property at night. So whose job is it? The sheriff’s office can hardly be expected to police who is accessing the property and who is flying what where. Even though it definitely isn’t my job, it has fallen to me to report illegal camping and the more egregious activities like weddings, drug dealing, and the unmonitored large-scale slash burning HRVPRD performed only one month after the smoky devastation of the Eagle Creek Fire. Also, in addition to being nuisances, I would argue that drug dealing, nighttime loitering, and camera-equipped drones spying on neighbors introduce safety concerns that HRVPRD needs to address.
        <p>After the wedding that was held on the property in May, I contacted Director Mark Hickok. I subsequently had the conversation with him I have referred to throughout this statement, a conversation during which I raised many of these concerns. I then followed up with a specific complaint about the recurring violation of the no-fly zone. Nothing was done regarding that violation, since HRVPRD doesn’t enforce its posted rules. I received no follow up regarding my other concerns. I am now writing to the HRVPRD Board to ask that HRVPRD enforce its posted rules and follow the conditions of its land use permit. I have outlined relevant issues in detail, realizing that Board members might not be aware of them. I hope that these issues will be addressed by the Board at an upcoming meeting, and appropriate corrective actions will be considered. Please let me know what actions will ultimately be taken.</p>       

<p>Thank you for the time and consideration you give to this matter. If you have any questions, please let me know.</p>
