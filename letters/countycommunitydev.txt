<p>Subject: RE: Comments on the Barrett Property/KB</p>

<p>Mark and Keir-</p>

 

<p>First of all, thanks to you both for reaching out to the Planning Department and for seeking additional insight and clarification to my earlier email, which in all fairness was a bit terse given our ongoing workload. I should have taken the time to provide a more thoughtful responses and greater details. That said however, I would like to make it clear that the County Planning Department is unable to serve as a mediator for this ongoing conflict. If verifiable and egregious violations occur, we will investigate and, if necessary, pursue enforcement action, but we will not respond to minor day-to-day issues, such as someone running their dog off-leash or wandering off the trail to have a picnic. Therefore, I would again invite you both to sit down and have an open conversation about how to address each other’s primary concerns. I think there is plenty of room to provide reasonable solutions that are effective and positive to both sides.</p>

 

<p>Now to your questions, the Park District is authorized to use the property for a trail and an RC Flyer Field. No other formal recreational uses have been authorized. As owner of the property, the Park District is ultimately responsible to ensure that it is used in a manner that conforms to the requirements of the County Zoning Ordinance, the conditions of its permit, and any other requirements/laws in effect regarding the use of the property. However, we also understand that 100% compliance, every day is unrealistic given that the property is made open and available to the public, who may not entirely know or care about the restrictions on how the property is used. We do not expect the Park District to hire a security guard to monitory the property 24/7, but do believe that some strategic efforts could be made to minimize unauthorized use of the property and conflicts, such as the following:</p>

 

<p>(1) sign the property in a way that clearly and effectively communicates the appropriate/authorized use of the property;</p>

<p>(2) preclude any messaging, advertising, or the like that would explicitly or implicitly encourage public use of the property beyond its approved use as a trail and RC Flyer Field;</p>

<p>(3) avoid managing the grounds in any way that would invite unpermitted activities; and</p>

<p>(4) monitor the property, as practicable, and if necessary empower Park District employees to discourage unauthorized activities when witnessed, as they would at any other Park District facility.</p>

 

<p>In response to your other questions below (Keir’s original questions/comments are in black, Mark’s comments are in blue, Keir’s later comments are in green, and my original comments are in red, while my latest responses are in bolded/underlined red):</p>

<p>-Hiking to the trail (Order P-09-0296 allowing the trail specifically states that no parking lot serving the trail will be provided, implying further permitting would be needed to establish any parking area. I realize that this order was written before the orchard was removed, but I wonder if you could clarify on whether the parking lot serving the RC field is allowed to also serve as the parking lot for the trail). The parking area developed to serve the RC flyer field was not approved for use as a trailhead for the Indian Creek Trail. The entrance to the parking area is currently signed “Radio Control Flier Entrance” and fifty feet later there are two signs that state “Spectator area, and Flyer Area”.  Does the county have an expectation that the parks district monitors the parking area a regulates the use of patrons who park there? Although I think the existing signing is fine, as it does not encourage improper parking, I think it could be improved by having the sign simply say “Parking for Radio Control Flyers and Spectators Only. All Other Parking Prohibited,” or something similar. If necessary, you could also add some standard tow warning signs, which might further emphasize the restrictions on parking.</p>   

<p>-Off leash dog park/dog park for individuals not utilizing the RC field. Not approved. There are at least six signs on the property that state dogs must be on leash.</p>

<p>Regardless of how many signs there are, HRVPRD does not have a permit to operate a dog park on the property. Increasingly, people come to the property solely to exercise their dogs and park in the RC parking lot. Some people come every day. These people are not RC operators, a distinction I sought to make in my original sentence.</p> 

<p>100% of the dogs I see on the property are exercised off leash. The property does not have the fencing necessary for a dog park, and trespass by visiting dogs is increasing. This Saturday, my cat was nearly chased into Barrett Drive by a visiting dog while I watched from my roof. Less than a week earlier, a pack of visiting dogs chased my cat through my property. These are just the instances I have seen, and they are unacceptable. I think the signing that already exists related to leashing dogs is fine. As you mentioned Mark, it may be appropriate/necessary to complete the fence started around Keir’s property as another way to minimize the types of issues described. Not a requirement, but it might be worth discussing further with Keir as another potential remedy.</p>

 

<p>-Day use recreation area for parking, picnicking, frisbee, car repair, restroom use, etc. by individuals not utilizing the RC field.  Not approved. If someone is walking the trail and they decide to have a picnic or throw a frisbee, does the county have an expectation that HRVPRD should tell them to leave? Technically, as property owner, you are responsible for how the property is used. Although the Planning Department has no intention of enforcing against minor, occasional infractions, it does expect that the Park District take reasonable steps, such as those listed above (Items 1-4), to discourage unauthorized activities.</p>

<p>Most of the non-RC affiliated use of this property does not involve people accessing the property from the trail. It involves people entering the property by car from Barrett Drive.</p>

 

<p>-Occurrences of overnight camping and a wedding.  Not approved. Overnight Camping is not allowed in any of our parks and in thirteen years of ownership there has only been one wedding which was held without our permission.</p>

<p>As HRVPRD continues to publish material that promotes the property as a public park/open space and the property is recognized as such, these kind of occurrences will only increase. The proximity of the parking lot to my property makes overnight camping/parking of particular concern to me. I looked at the Park District’s website and did not see anything written that would overtly promote Barrett Park for unauthorized uses, especially weddings and overnight camping.</p>  

 

<p>-Permanent interpretative signs welcoming the general public to the property.  Not approved. I’ve attached a picture of our interpretive signage that explains the parks district’s history with the property (a question that frequently comes up). It is consistent with other interpretive signage in our parks system. Given that the radio flyer field is an allowable use, do you see an issue with this sign? Although the sign seems historically accurate, the last paragraph is not ideal, especially the part that says… “Local residents and visitors who come to the area to experience the natural bounties of the Hood River Valley are invited to enjoy the open space and scenic vistas at Barrett Park…” In my opinion, this statement does not align with item 2 above as it seems to implicitly encourage use of the property beyond just walking the trail or flying an RC aircraft. Some wordsmithing, or outright removal of this paragraph, is recommended to eliminate all doubt. </p> 

<p>HRVPRD has a second permanent sign for the RC field next to this sign outlining property rules and flying protocol. There is third sign attached to the fence which largely replicates the information in the second sign.</p>

<p>HRVPRD has no signs on the property that say "No public access," or "Closed to public use" Instead, the last sentence of the first interpretive sign in the photo is: "Local residents and and visitors who come to the area to experience the natural bounties of the Hood River Valley are invited to enjoy the open space and scenic vistas at Barrett Park, and envision its eventual transformation into a more varied community recreation space."</p>

 

<p>-Promoting the property as an open space open to the public.  Not approved.</p>

 

<p>-Using the barn as the District's maintenance workshop and equipment storage facility serving the District at large.  Not approved. Is storing and maintaining mowing equipment, and a tractor that are primarily used at Barrett Park allowed? Yes.</p>

<p>HRVPRD may intend to limit usage of the barn thus going forward, but from my observation it has been used in a wider capacity since HRVPRD acquired the property. </p>

<p>The property is largely mowed by a contractor. The smaller mowing equipment used by HRVPRD seems to be used districtwide as HRVPRD employees tow it in and out of the property on a trailer. </p>

<p>Good morning Keir.</p>

<p>Thank you for your email and notifying the Planning Department of your concerns.</p>

<p>You are correct that the County Planning Dept is the agency responsible for ensuring permit compliance. However, in this instance, the permit conditions that you site below, which originated from Land Use Permit #14-0054, were actually revoked soon after the permit was issued in 2014 after it was determined that a radio flyer field is an outright allowed land use in the Exclusive Farm Use (EFU) zone per Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) 215.283(1)(q). By law, a local jurisdiction cannot impose additional restrictions or further regulate such uses. (For more information, see attached documents.) </p> 

<p>For these reasons, the Planning Department has no authority to compel the Park District to comply with the conditions listed in your email. Consequently, I would encourage you to continue to work with the HRVPRD staff and Board to seek resolution of the concerns raised.</p>

<p>Sorry that I am unable to assist you at this time.</p>
