<p>Dear Commissioners,</p> 

<p>I am writing to you because I would like to start a conversation/offer testimony to the Hood River County Board of Commissioners about my experience living next to Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District’s RC flying field/ 
Barrett Park.</p>

<p>As I am sure you are aware, the BOC denied HRVPRD a conditional use permit to develop the property for a second time in December, 2013. 
In Jan/Feb 2014, former parks district director Lori Stirn allowed the Columbia Gorge Aeromodelers, a private club, to install an RC runway at Barrett 85 feet from my property. So not only did Lori Stirn put an RC field in our neighborhood, she did it in the most disrespectful and invasive way possible.
Then Lori Stirn planted two interpretive signs on the property, removed the gate at the entrance, and opened for business.</p>



<p>My quality of life has been declining ever since. The noise and electronic harassment I experience as a result of this RC field has affected every facet of my life.  
In recent years, I have experienced RC noise nearly every day, and I am often forced to wear earplugs or leave my property to get away from it. Every spring and summer weekend brings shrieking, invasive noise, often from morning till dusk.
I can hear the RC noise inside my house.
Camera equipped drones fly over my house.
In addition, I have experienced theft, vandalism, trespassing, threats, intimidation, and vicious verbal abuse from visitors to the property. I have chased drug dealers and users off the property at a risk to myself. I have nearly been hit by a car speeding out of the property while walking down to my mailbox. My cat was hit on the access road by a non-authorized user in the middle of the night in October, 2020.</p>

<p>Also since 2014, Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District has operated the property as an open space, off leash dog park, and rest area open to the public dawn to dusk/365 days a year. Night time activity is common.
Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District uses the barn on the property as a maintenance shed and to store equipment used district wide.
HRC County Planner Eric Walker confirmed to me in writing that all of these uses-public open space, off leash dog park, rest area, and maintenance shed-violate ORS 215.283, which outlines permitted uses on EFU zoned land. 
Then Mr Walker told me in writing that he would not enforce ORS 215.283 in the case of Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District and Barrett Park. He only required a small sign at the entrance that restricts parking to RC hobbyists, not a gate. Of course, this sign is ignored by the public and Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District does not enforce it.</p>

<p>Why does the fact there is one allowed use of the property occurring-a model aircraft flying field-allow Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District to open the property to the general public for NON-allowed uses dawn to dusk and beyond/365 days per year in violation of ORS 215.283?</p>

<p>Why does public employee Eric Walker get to decide whether to enforce Oregon land use law?</p>

<p>Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District also refuses to enforce any of their own posted rules on the property. Including those specific to the RC flying field. Over and over, they tell me to call the sheriff if there are issues, putting responsibility for policing the property on me, a private citizen. The sheriff’s department tells me they cannot enforce park rules or limit access to RC activities only.</p>

<p>So Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District gets to have their park after all, despite not having the required conditional use permit, as they wait for a more favourable lineup at the HRC Board of Commissioners to green-light further development.</p>

<p>I have made repeated and sustained attempts to appeal to both the Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation Board and management about how invasive and destructive this situation is to my life. </p>
<p>I am either fobbed off with token fixes (like the sign), bullied by HRVPRD management, or ignored completely. </p>
<p>I have extensive documentation of this situation including a written log, hundreds of photographs, videos, and all of the correspondence with HRVPRD and Eric Walker.</p>
<p>I have recently started a YouTube channel:</p> 

<p>https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCqOvnK0lYBXJ9yHJuGeer5A</p>

<p>I have demonstrated to HRVPRD that their property doesn’t even meet field size guidelines published by the Academy of Model Aeronautics for the kind of planes flown there. </p>
<p>They don’t care. </p>
<p>There is zero oversight of the hobbyists. </p>
<p>They have unfettered access to the property. </p>
<p>Including the airspaces of neighbors and the out of bounds areas.</p>

<p>I am a long time HRC resident, a hardworking journeyman electrician, a taxpayer and a voter, yet Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District has shown zero respect to me as either a resident and private property owner or as a human being. 
I did not “move to the situation,” an argument some RC hobbyists have used to shut down the complaints of one my neighbors. My residency at this location predated HRVPRD purchasing the former orchard next to me. My parents bought my property in 1977.
Nevertheless, I am told that if I don’t like the noise I shouldn’t live next to an RC field.
I am told that they will fly “when and where they want” and I will “take it.”</p>

<p>I have found nowhere else in Oregon where a public RC flying field open dawn to dusk/365 days per year has been installed in a residential area 85 feet from a neighboring property. Only HRVPRD is so callous. 
Even the Academy of Model Aeronautics recommends considering sound sensitivity and proximity to neighbors when selecting a flying site.
Situating an RC field immediately adjacent to established residences is wrong. 
Subjecting residents to flyovers and surveillance with camera equipped drones is wrong.
Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District came into our neighborhood with no respect for our lives or rights as private property owners. Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District has made this an ugly place to live.
Are these Hood River County values?
Is this how special districts supported by tax dollars should treat hard working residents?</p>

<p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with you or answer any questions you might have. </p>
<p>Thank you for your time and attention.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>
