        <p class="emphasis">Outline your plan to use funding as efficiently as possible to provide necessary services to as many people as possible.</p>

      <p>Frankly, administration of parks in Hood River County is inefficient. We have four separate agencies with administrators and maintenance staff. There is talk of resolving this, and it needs to happen. In my opinion, this is one of the biggest waste of resources in the County. Does it make sense to have multiple operations managers? Four sets of equipment? Two maintenance trucks travelling up to Odell? I believe in streamlining administrative costs to save taxpayers money. Resources could be reallocated to support sliding scale access to programs and facilities and to provide better wages and benefits to our maintenance workers. We need to sort park management in Hood River County into a well organized, cohesive system before we start talking about a permanent tax rate hike for Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District.</p>

      <p class="emphasis">How do you plan to involve residents of the district in decision making? How will you keep them informed of district activities?</p>

      <p>Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District could do a better job at both informing and involving residents. I believe that there should be more opportunities for residents to get involved and help guide policy via auxiliary advisory boards, more frequent community meetings, online surveys, and more publicly posted volunteer opportunities. The internet and social media is ubiquitous, but we have to acknowledge it may fail to reach all residents and keep them informed. Whether quarterly or biannually, a bilingual newsletter mailed to households may be an option to consider. Elected officials should be available and accountable to the public. As a board member, I would be open and responsive to all comments and concerns. One of the best ways to foster involvement and inclusion is to have a conversation.</p>

  <p class="emphasis">What aspect of working for the District is most important to you?</p>

    <p>Advocating for thoughtful development of public green spaces and recreational facilities in Hood River County. Hood River is diverse both in terms of community demographics and land use. To me, thoughtful development is environmentally and socially ethical development. What are the impacts? Is the development a fair and equitable use of community resources? Are we following a sustainable ecological model? Are we protecting wild places and agricultural land? To this end, I would like to see Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation District partner more closely with local environmental advocacy and conservation groups such as Thrive Hood River and Comunidades.</p>

       <p class="emphasis">1. What inspired you to run for a position on Hood River Valley Parks and Recreation Board?</p>

      <p>It is often said that parks are the heart of a community. I am running because I believe Hood River deserves a thriving parks district that respects and serves each one of us equally.</p>

      <p>As an immediate neighbor of Barrett Park, I have experienced firsthand the negative impacts caused by a poorly run recreational property that disenfranchises the community members who live nearby.</p>

      <p>I believe that going forward we need to be more thoughtful with land use and development, preserving our valuable agricultural lands, our trees and other natural spaces. </p>

      <p class="emphasis">2. What do you hope to bring to the Board of Directors?</p>

      <p>I hope to be a pragmatic, compassionate voice for working families and an advocate for transparency and community involvement on the parks board.</p>

      <p>I think Hood River deserves a parks board that better reflects our diverse community.</p>

      <p>I am an electrician. I belong to a labor union and I work with the tools everyday. Too often, working class/blue collar residents are absent from the elected boards that shape our communities.</p> 

      <p>Equity starts with representation, and as your elected representative I would welcome any and all input about what HRVPRD is doing right and where improvement is needed.</p>

      <p class="emphasis">3. What do you believe are the biggest issues facing the parks district and how do you plan to tackle these issues?</p>

      <p>Funding and ethical expansion of district-managed parkland, facilities and programs.</p>

      <p>Whether you’re building an electrical system or managing a parks district, I know success requires an accurate blueprint and financial solvency.</p>

      <p>With important decisions on the horizon involving capital projects and putting a permanent tax hike on the ballot, I believe residents deserve a greater role in establishing that blueprint.</p>

      <p>To that end, I support establishing a youth council as well as citizen advisory boards that oversee capital projects. I think the tax hike needs to be reevaluated, but support the district’s strategy of diversifying its revenue stream.</p>
